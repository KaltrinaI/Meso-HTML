        We start our day at the crack of dawn to bake our own muffins, bread, and dinner rolls. Loaves not used that day are donated to the local food shelter.Yeast can be tricky at first, but once you learn how to proof yeast, you should be all set. The trick is to make sure the water is not too hot. Don't go higher than about 110 degrees.Kneading bread is simple. Flour your worktop, then push, pull and stretch the dough until it's nice and smooth. When it's properly kneaded, the dough should be stretchy and smooth.Proofing bread allows the yeast to do its work to help the dough grow. To proof bread, place the bread in a greased bowl and let rest in a warm, humid environment until it doubles in size. If you're having trouble getting the dough to proof, use these proofing tricks.You can store homemade bread in a plastic bag or a bread box for maximum freshness. If you don't think you can finish it in a few days' time, you can also freeze bread. Just wrap it up in plastic and pop in the freezer. It'll keep for a few months. If your bread has gone a bit stale, you can always use it to make homemade croutons, French toast or bread pudding. </p>

        <p id="b"><img src="thumbnails/burgers-200.jpg" alt="juicy burgers on a cutting board" width="170" height="170"> People come from all over to enjoy our lovingly made burgers. We grind our own locally-sourced organic beef and turkey so you know it's fresh and free from fillers and other nonsense. Go for one of our creative topping combos or stick with the classics.Who doesn’t love a big, tender, juicy steakhouse burger? Problem is, they’re difficult to replicate at home because most steakhouses blend different cuts of beef — like sirloin, chuck, and short ribs — to customize the flavor and fat content of their burgers. It’s certainly possible to grind your own meat or ask your butcher for a special blend, but it’s not always practical. Fortunately, there’s an easier way. By combining ordinary supermarket ground beef with a panade — or mixture of bread and milk — and lots of seasoning, you can make steakhouse-style burgers in no time. These burgers have made me a star among my children’s friends. My daughter’s friend Allie nicknamed them “Segal Burgers” — it stuck, and now we all call them that too. </p>
